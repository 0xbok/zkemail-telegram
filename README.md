# A zkemail gated access to a telegram group

> Incomplete project

Idea: Prove that you received YC rejection mail but were in the top 10% of applicants (YC includes this information in the rejection mail). If proven, you can join a telegram group. Immediately become part of the motivated founder group, share advice, team up via the group chat.

## Current status
Lot of time went into telegram specific setup during the hackathon.
